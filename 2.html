  CSS Level 2 Revision 1 corrects errors in the 1998 Recommendation
  of CSS level 2 and adds a select few highly requested features
  originally planned for level 3, which have already been widely
  implemented. But most of all CSS 2.1 represents a ‘snapshot’
  of CSS usage: it consists of all CSS features that are implemented
  interoperably for HTML and XML at the date of publication of the
  Recommendation.
